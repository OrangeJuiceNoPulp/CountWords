This program counts the number of times that words occur in a specified .txt file where each word is on a new line.

The results are written into a specified .txt file, or "output.txt" by default.

The result for word occurrences is case-insensitive. ("HAPPY", "Happy" and "happy" are all counted as occurrences of the word "happy")


Usage:

java -jar CountWords.jar [input filename/path] [output filename]
